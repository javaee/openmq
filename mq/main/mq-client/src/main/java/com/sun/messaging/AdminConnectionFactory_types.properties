#
# <PropertyName> defines the TYPE of the property
#
# Valid types are --
#   com.sun.messaging.PropertyOwner
#   java.lang.Boolean
#   java.lang.Integer
#   java.lang.String
#   java.lang.Long
#   List
#
#   When the type is com.sun.messaging.PropertyOwner,
#   the value names a classname that implements the
#   interface, which can be used to interrogate to
#   obtain properties, defaults, types and labels.
#
#   When the type is List, the following additional
#   properties deliver more information.
#   <PropertyName>.List defines a string that uses the `|'
#       character to separate strings that can be used in a
#       choice element.
#       The special string `...' is used to indicate that a
#       the value of another property is to be used instead.
#       (<PropertyName>.property.other defines this, which
#        can be another List etc.)
#   <PropertyName>.<ListItem>.properties defines the properties
#   affected by making `ListItem' the value of the property
#   that is of type `List'.
#   <PropertyName>.<ListItem>.<PropertyName> defines the value that
#   the property named above takes.
#      i.e. This is a way to abbreviate values.
