 * This a general purpose Vector class.  The class only stores void*
 * elements, so it is up to the caller to know the type of what is
 * being stored.
 *
 * When ~Vector() or reset() is called, all memory is deallocated and
 * each element (i.e. each void* pointer that was stored) is deleted.
 * Therefore, it is dangerous to keep alternate pointers to elements
 * stored in the vector because they will be invalid if the Vector is
 * deleted.  Also, note that the destructor for the object will NOT be
 * called.
 *
 * It is currently only optimized for appending elements to the end of
 * the vector by calling add() and for retrieving an element at a
 * specific index.
